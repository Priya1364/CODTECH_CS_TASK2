# Web Vulnerability Scanner

## 🔐 Project Title
Web Vulnerability Scanner Using Python

## 📖 Description
This project was developed as part of the CODTECH Cyber Security Internship – Task 2.
The objective of this tool is to identify common web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection
and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by testing web application URLs using automated payloads.

The scanner helps security analysts and developers find security weaknesses before
they can be exploited by attackers.

## 🎯 Features
✔ Detects SQL Injection vulnerabilities  
✔ Tests for XSS attacks  
✔ Works on real vulnerable websites  
✔ Displays vulnerable URLs  
✔ Simple command-line interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Requests library  
- HTTP GET requests  
- Vulnerable test websites  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The user enters a target website URL  
2. The scanner injects SQL and XSS payloads  
3. The server response is analyzed  
4. If vulnerabilities are found, they are displayed
